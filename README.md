# Python Weather Application w/ GUI

This project is a weather aggregate that pulls in weather predictions from the Government of Canada's [weather service](https://weather.gc.ca/) and displays them in a table. It is currently hard-coded with a selection of regions in the province of Nova Scotia and presents the data in an hour-by-hour format.
